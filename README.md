### **ACL-BioNLP'19 - MEDIQA 2019 Shared Task**
#### Authors: Gonzalo Recio and Jana Revent√≥s 

The **MEDIQA 2019 Challenge** aims to attract further research efforts in Natural Language Inference (NLI), Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE), and their applications in medical Question Answering (QA). 

In this repository we focus on the implementation of the **Task 3: Question and Answering**.
The **main objective** of this task is to filter and improve the ranking of automatically retrieved answers generated in the QA CHiQA system (https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/). 
CHiQA is an experimental AI system that is learning how to answer health-related questions using reliable sources for patients.
